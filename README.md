# Call For Help

Call For Help is an app-based solution proposed by us(X_Code team) towards the COVID-19 track. We have developed this project considering
the ease of its usage by every age group users.

# Short Description


## What's the problem ?

Due to the Covid-19 outbreak mainly the poor ones are affected the most. It has been difficult for them to even have "food twice a day".
The supplies and help from the government are either not distributed properly or not reaching the right candidate. And also there is no 
proper way to communicate with the authorities or Get help from people who are willing to help. Because of the rapid increase in Covid-19
cases it's hard to track or get accurate/realtime data of cases all around. Most of the people are unaware of the symptoms and preventive
measures.

## How can technology help?

Currently people are disconnected from each others. The voices of needy people are not able to reach the concerned authorities.There are
people willing to help but they are not able to do so. In this scenario technology can bridge the gap between these people through
communication medias. Using technology we can provide a common platform for requesting or offering help and supplies. Also it can be
helpful to provide updated informations about the situation. It can help by assisting people to identify if they have the symptoms of
corona virus.


## The Idea

The idea is to help those in need by providing them with an app. The app will provide a common platform with the features like live data,
chat bot and useful informations regarding Covid-19 that may help in combating the pandemic situation.
